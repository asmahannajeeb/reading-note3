# what we learned 
we talked about HTML and worked alittle bit on it 
and we knew that CSS an JS is really important for HTML
so when we do a web bage we have to use them all .


and we learned about github a little bit and we made an account there but what I understand that if I want to be a developer I must to have an account on github and kbow hot to work on markdown .

and we also downloaded windows terminal and ubnutu so we can be able to work on programming languages .
